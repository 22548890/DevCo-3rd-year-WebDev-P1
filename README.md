# Web-development project spec:
We were required to create a web-based developer contracting platform that is focused on
connecting companies that require developers for set-term contracting work. There was two
types of users, Companies and Developers. Companies must be able to register their company
on the platform and start posting contracts for work which they require. The companies must be
able to view all developers that have applied for a contract and must be able to accept a
developer that they want. On the other hand, developers can view the company and the details 
about the contract and decide whether or not they would like to apply for that contract.


## Things to note:
- This was a group project of 6 developers
- I was responsible for most of the front-end development using React as our stack
